REQUIREMENT:
I am assuming that you already have a MySQL, or SQL Server available for your use, as well as you've all the necessary privileges,

1) Make sure you have a running server on your computer or laptap
2)Download the zip file and unzipped it on your desktop
3)Copy the entire folder as it's to your C\driver inside of htdocs folder( htdocs is located
inside of xampp server.
4)After copying successfull the entire folder that you have just downloaded .
Now it's time to create  database "storemovie" . Go to your PhpMyAdmin and create a database
called "storemovie".
5) import the tables to the database. we have two tables (users and movies table).
select the database you just created now (storemovie) and click the import button  and it
will open another windows there you will see choose File. then choose file and import it by clicking go.

NB: the database folders are also inside of database-tables
